# Java
This initiative is dedicated to personal exploration of Java. Throughout this journey, I'll be referencing YouTube tutorials and embarking on a variety of projects, ranging from simple concepts to more intricate ones.

> The overarching goal is to craft multiple projects to grasp every facet of Java.

For a structured progression, I'll be following this [guide](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/10-backend-projects-%EF%B8%8F-for-transitioning-to-a-senior-level-developer-3391075935aa) which emphasizes Backend Projects üèóÔ∏è to Elevate to a Senior Developer Level üôå.
